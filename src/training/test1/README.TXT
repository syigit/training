1. Introduction
---------------
Congratulations, you've just downloaded and decompressed the WebExplorer ZIP
archive file.

WebExplorer  is a bare-bones Java Web-crawling application.  All its output
simply goes to the console, and if you wish to halt the program you need to
stop it using a plain old CTRL-C.

Not burdening the program with any GUI issues means the source code will be
that much more instructive to you.




2. Installing Instructions
--------------------------
As this Java program is not an applet, but a Java application, you can't run
the program from a Java-aware browser like Netscape's Navigator.

You  need  any  of  the  available  Java  interpreters,  like  Sun's "java"
interpreter (available free as part of Sun's JDK, see http://www.sun.com).

The  only requirement to run WebExplorer is that your CLASSPATH environment
variable points to your current directory (it should already do so).

WebCrawler does not require any initialization or other files, and it does
not  create  any  files  on your computer system, it only goes "out" on the
Web to fetch HTML pages.





3. Running WebExplorer
----------------------
Go to the directory where you unpacked the WebExplorer archive.

To run WebExplorer, simply start your chosen Java interpreter, giving it
"WebExplorer" plus a URL as arguments.

For example, on a Windows 95 machine using Sun's JDK, you would type at the
(MSDOS box) command line prompt:

           "java WebExplorer http://www.yoursiteofinterest.com"

WebExplorer  should now start crawling all over the Web, starting from that
site.
